        <h1 id="Martin">Travel to Martin Land</h1>
        <h3>Where is it located? </h3>
        <p>The island is located on a very remote distance in the middle of the <strong>Pacific Ocean.</strong> A mentally disabled millioner named Martin Palikarsky bought the island a long time ago and has populatted it with a few things. </p>
        <h3>What can you see in Martin Land?</h3>
        <p> When you visit Martin Land there ar many beautiful and interesting place. The first place I recommend you to visit is the house where Martin Palikarsky lived. It is a hounded house. There is a story, which says that after his dead, a witch casted a spell on him, making his body become one with the house.</p>
        <img src ="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/FairbanksHouse2013.jpg" width="50%">
        <p>While visiting the house I reccomend you taking a tour of it. Inside you will be able to see how the crazy Martin leaved. You can see things like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>the room where Martin tortured innocent people</strong> </li>
            <li><strong>his strange orianted living room</strong></li>
            <li><strong>the bedroom with a huge artillery of guns</strong></li>

        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/MG42-Display.jpg/320px-MG42-Display.jpg">
        </ul>
        <p>Another thing, which I recommend when visiting is <em>having breakfast in Molly's cafes</em>. It is one of the only "restaraunts" on the island, but it serves the <strong>BEST</strong> waffles in the world. You can pick whatever toping you want and enjoy it with a side of a milkshake. In the cafe you can also read or ask about the story of how Molly's place was created - it is related to <em>Martin The Crazy</em>. </p>
               <h3>What to bring?</h3>
               <ol>
                   <li>Suncream</li>
                   <li>Warm clothes</li>
                   <li>A lot of smiles</li>
               </ol>
        <h2>I have been to Martin Land a lot of times and I really recommend it to anybody who likes horror movies or would like to feel a bit of adrenaline go up his veins!</h2>
