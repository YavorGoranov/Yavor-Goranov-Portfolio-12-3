        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> 
Pat shrimp dry with paper towels and place in a small bowl. Add 1 teaspoon canola oil and 1/2 teaspoon fish sauce. Mix well and set aside in the refrigerator.
</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong>Place rice noodles in a large bowl and cover with boiling water. Let stand for 5 minutes. Drain noodles in a colander, rinse with cold running water, then drain until dry. Using scissors, cut the bundle of noodles in half.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong>Place garlic in a small bowl and add soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, white pepper, sugar, and remaining 2 teaspoons fish sauce. Mix well and set sauce aside.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong>Heat 1 teaspoon canola oil in a wok or nonstick skillet over high heat, tilting to swirl oil, until smoking. Add eggs and let cook undisturbed for about 10 second, then gently move the eggs back and forth with a spatula until they start to firm up. Break the eggs into small pieces, then set aside in a large bowl.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong>Wipe wok clean. Return wok to high heat, add 2 teaspoons oil and heat until smoking. Add shrimp and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Add roast pork and onion and continue to stir-fry for another 30 seconds. Add red bell pepper and snow peas and stir for another 30 seconds, then add carrots. Add 1 teaspoon curry powder, season with salt, and cook, tossing, until curry is evenly distributed. Scrape wok contents into bowl with eggs.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong>Wipe the wok clean again. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons canola oil over high heat until smoking. Add the rice-stick noodles and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Add the sauce and remaining 2 teaspoons curry powder. Stir until the curry powder is evenly distributed. Return egg, shrimp, roast pork, and vegetables to wok and stir-fry until everything is evenly combined, about 30 seconds. Season with salt and remove from heat. Add scallions, drizzle with sesame oil, mix well, and transfer to a large serving bowl. Enjoy immediately.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Twenty-four hours before making ice cream, place the freezer bowl of your electric ice cream maker in the freezer. Check your maker’s manual for specific instructions.<br>
            <strong>Step 2:</strong> In a small saucepan, heat the cream, milk and vanilla extract on medium-low for 15 minutes. Be sure to stir occasionally and not to let it boil.<br>
            <strong>Step 3:</strong>Meanwhile, in a large mixing bowl, add the yolks and sugar. With a whisk, break the yolks and combine with the sugar.<br>
            <strong>Step 4:</strong>Remove the liquid from the stovetop and temper the yolk mixture. To temper the yolks, whisk the eggs quickly while slowly adding the warm liquid (about 1/4 cup at a time) until all the liquid is combined.<br>
            <strong>Step 5:</strong> Cover the bowl and place in the fridge. Let it chill for at least 2 hours, up to 24 hours. Place the ice cream mixture into the ice cream maker and mix for 20 minutes, or until the ice cream is thickened to the desired consistency. </p>

           <p> <strong>Step 1:</strong> Pizza dough is actually pretty forgiving, as long as you know your ingredients. Use all-purpose flour for a softer crust, or buy bread flour for a crispy crust. Remember to add active dry yeast. The real trick, though, is in the kneading. Pizza dough should be elastic, which means it needs a lot of kneading to get it consistently stretchy. Keep it in the mixer or under your hands for at least 10 minutes.<br>
            <strong>Step 2:</strong> Good sauce comes from fresh ingredients. Make your pizza sauce from fresh, locally sourced tomatoes. You can peel them with ease by dropping them in boiling water for 30 seconds to loosen the skin. Then, opt for fresh oregano, basil, and other herbs instead of dried versions. Chop plenty of garlic (if desired), and add salt, pepper, and white sugar to taste as you simmer for at least 30 minutes. Pro tip: a little baking soda will give the sauce extra body.<br>
            <strong>Step 3:</strong>As always, choose fresh, local ingredients when available, but be careful about the liquids. Grease and fruit juice (think pineapple) makes for a sloppy pizza. Be conservative about fatty meats, and make sure to thoroughly drain any fruits you use. Try interesting cheese combinations as well. Mozzarella is a must, but other cheeses like chevre (goat cheese) and asiago add texture and flavourful dimensions.<br>
            <strong>Step 4:</strong> Good, evenly baked pizza needs a baking stone, although the stone will make your oven take longer to preheat. Remember to sprinkle cornmeal over the stone before heating so your pizza won't stick. Also, invest in a good baking peel or flat sheet for easy retrieval from the oven.<br>
            <strong>Step 5:</strong> Pizza wants a hot oven, as much as 230 degrees C. Brush your dough with olive oil before baking to prevent wet ingredients from soaking in. This also gives the crust a golden brown surface in such high heat. Pizza-making pros also know that adding a little extra cheese in the last five minutes of the 15-minute baking time will improve the texture and give the pizza some tooth. </p>
